I need to produce an mcp server that can retrieve information in a RAG system to assist me with coding applications.  I need you to help me come up with a rubric for the creation of this project by helping me to think of benefits to myself that I don't already know.

Here is a rough layout of what I need:

1. Document text extraction.  I have mostly .pdf documents that will need to have the text extracted from them and stored in a json dictionary that can be used downstearm.  Most likely, these will be textbooks with chapters, sections, appendices and a bibliography.  I need this information categorized for retrieval.
2. Next the document needs to be vectorized using an embedding model.  I plan to use the nomic-text-embed model with a 1024 embedding.  However, the code needs to be flexible enought to accomodate another embedder.  IN addition, any useful summaries of the docuemnt will need to be stored in another vector database to further enhance the ability of a LLM to retrieve the data.
3.  Next, the database needs to be accesible to me asynchronously in an MCP server that I can use to help with downstream processes.  I will need relevant tools for page search, semantic search, hybrid text and semantic searches and any others that can help a large language model to easily identify relavant text within the Lancedb to add to context.


What I require:
- A singular database containing many tables.  One table per document
- An additional reference database that will contain summary information on each document that is encoded and can be passed as context to help a model find a relevant document
- A multi type formatting with error handling that can accommodate many different types of documents (articles, blogs, books) but an emphasis on textbooks.
- Use only accesss to open sourced llm models and their relvant codebase.
- It will require cli functionality for embedding so that documents can be 
- Any equations that you find need to be properly documented in Latex format with documentation,

What you will do:
- Advise on the creation of a codebase that can embed a variety of documents.
- Help me to identify any processes that I may not have already thought of.
- Create procedures for each step of the creation of the codebase.

### Reasoning

Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants to create an MCP server for a RAG system to help with coding. They've outlined some steps but need a rubric and advice on the codebase.

First, I need to understand their requirements. They mentioned document text extraction from PDFs, vectorization with an embedding model, and a database setup. They also want a server for asynchronous access with various search types. The user emphasized using open-source models and CLI functionality for embedding.

In the previous thought, I started by analyzing the components and considering benefits like scalability and modularity. Now, I need to think about the next steps. Maybe I should break down each component into subtasks. For example, document extraction could involve PDF parsing, text cleaning, and structuring into JSON. Then, vectorization needs model integration and flexibility for different embedders.

I should also consider processes they might have missed. Maybe data preprocessing steps, error handling for different document formats, or how to handle equations in LaTeX. Also, the server architecture—how to structure the API endpoints for different search types. Testing and validation procedures are important too.

Another aspect is the reference database for summaries. How to generate summaries? Maybe using another open-source summarization model. Ensuring that the summaries are stored efficiently and can be retrieved quickly for context.

CLI functionality requires designing commands for embedding documents, maybe with options to specify models or output formats. Error handling in the CLI for invalid inputs or failed processes.

I need to outline procedures for each step. For example, document processing: extract text, parse structure, clean, and store. Then, embedding: load model, process text in batches, store vectors. Database setup: schema design, indexing for search performance.

Potential challenges include handling large PDFs, managing different document structures, and ensuring the system's scalability. Also, making sure the code is modular so that switching embedders or adding new features is straightforward.

I should also think about the tools and libraries they might use. For PDF extraction, maybe PyPDF or pdfplumber. For embeddings, sentence-transformers or Hugging Face's transformers. The database could be LanceDB as mentioned. The server could be built with FastAPI for asynchronous handling.

Testing each component separately before integration is crucial. Unit tests for text extraction, vectorization accuracy, and search functionality. Integration tests to ensure all parts work together.

Documentation is another point. The user wants equations in LaTeX, so the code should detect and properly format equations. Also, user documentation for setting up the CLI and using the server.

Security considerations if the server is exposed, but since it's for personal use, maybe less critical. Still, input validation to prevent injection attacks.

I need to structure all these thoughts into a coherent plan, ensuring each part is addressed. The next thought should focus on breaking down the components into detailed procedures and identifying any missing steps.

### Reasoning

Okay, let's see. The user wants to create an MCP server for a RAG system to help with coding applications. They've outlined the main components: document text extraction, vectorization with an embedding model, and a database accessible via an MCP server with various search functionalities. They also want a rubric that includes benefits they might not have considered.

In the previous steps, I broke down the components into detailed procedures. Now, I need to think about the next step. The user mentioned wanting to identify processes they might have missed. So, maybe I should consider additional processes or features that enhance the system's functionality or usability.

First, data versioning and provenance tracking could be important. Keeping track of document versions and how they're processed ensures reproducibility. Then, maybe a feedback loop for the RAG system. If the user can provide feedback on retrieval results, the system can improve over time. 

Another thing is security and access control. Since it's their own server, they might want to restrict access or have authentication. Also, monitoring and logging for the server to track usage and errors. 

What about scalability? Ensuring the system can handle large documents or multiple users. Maybe asynchronous processing for embeddings to avoid bottlenecks. 

They also mentioned using open-source models. Perhaps including a model comparison tool to evaluate different embedders. And handling document formats beyond PDFs, like DOCX or text files, even though they focus on textbooks. 

I should also think about the CLI functionality. The user wants to process documents via CLI, so including batch processing commands and configuration management for different document types. 

Equation handling in LaTeX needs proper documentation, maybe a validation step to ensure equations are correctly parsed. 

Testing procedures for each component: unit tests for extraction, integration tests for the pipeline, and end-to-end tests for the server. 

Documentation is crucial too. They need clear guides for setup, usage, and contributing. 

Putting this all together, the next thought should outline these additional processes and benefits, ensuring the system is robust, user-friendly, and maintainable. This addresses potential gaps and enhances the project's value beyond their initial considerations.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user wants to create an MCP server for a RAG system to help with coding applications. They’ve outlined the main components: document text extraction, vectorization with embeddings, and a database setup for retrieval. They also mentioned using open-source models and CLI tools. Let me break down how to approach this.

First, I need to think about the document processing pipeline. They’re dealing with PDFs, especially textbooks. Extracting text from PDFs can be tricky because of different layouts. Tools like PyPDF or pdfplumber could work. But textbooks often have structured sections like chapters and appendices. Using regex to detect headers and subheaders would help in categorizing the content. Also, equations need to be in LaTeX. Maybe using a library like sympy to detect and convert equations to LaTeX.

Next, the embedding part. They want flexibility with models, so creating an abstraction layer makes sense. HuggingFace’s Transformers library allows switching between models easily. The nomic-text-embed model is a good start, but the system should allow swapping to other models like BERT or Sentence Transformers. Batch processing is important for efficiency, so implementing a queue system or parallel processing could help. Also, error handling for failed embeddings is crucial; maybe a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

For the database, using LanceDB with one table per document. Each table would store vectors and metadata. The reference database for summaries needs to have enhanced metadata, perhaps including key terms, document summaries, and even pre-generated embeddings for summaries. Indexing strategies like IVF-PQ (Inverted File with Product Quantization) would optimize search speed and memory usage.

The MCP server needs to support various search types. FastAPI is a good choice for building the API. Endpoints for page search (exact text), semantic search (vector similarity), and hybrid approaches combining both. Rate limiting and authentication should be included for security. Also, middleware to augment context for LLMs, maybe by prepending retrieved documents to the prompt.

CLI functionality for embedding documents. Using Click or argparse to create commands that process and embed documents. This allows users to easily add new documents without needing to interact with the server directly.

Unconsidered processes might include feedback loops where the system learns from user interactions to improve retrieval. Provenance tracking ensures that document versions and model versions are recorded for reproducibility. Security aspects like access control and query authentication are important, especially if the server is exposed to multiple users.

Performance optimizations like memory-mapped file processing can handle large textbooks efficiently. GPU acceleration for embeddings using libraries like PyTorch with CUDA support can speed up batch processing. Self-improvement mechanisms could involve monitoring model performance and automatically updating models or retraining based on new data.

Putting this all together, the codebase structure would have modules for document processing, embeddings, database interactions, the server API, and CLI tools. Each component should be modular to allow for easy updates and testing. Error handling and logging are essential throughout to catch issues early and provide useful diagnostics.

Testing each component separately is important. For example, unit tests for text extraction, integration tests for the embedding pipeline, and end-to-end tests for the server’s search functionality. Using a test database to avoid affecting production data during testing.

Documentation is key, especially for the CLI and API. Clear instructions on how to add documents, perform searches, and interpret results. Examples for common use cases, like querying a specific textbook chapter or retrieving similar documents based on a summary.

Finally, considering deployment. The server should be containerized with Docker for easy setup. Configuration files for different environments (development, production) to manage settings like database connections and model paths. Monitoring and logging setup to track performance and errors in production.

### Reasoning

Okay, let's break down what the user is asking for. They want to create an MCP server that integrates with a RAG system to assist with coding applications. The main components they've outlined are document text extraction, vectorization with embeddings, and an accessible database with various search functionalities.

First, I need to consider the user's requirements. They mentioned using a specific embedding model but want flexibility for others. They also want a structured database with multiple tables, a reference database for summaries, and handling different document types with a focus on textbooks. CLI functionality for embedding and proper LaTeX formatting for equations are also important.

The user is asking for advice on creating the codebase, identifying potential processes they might have missed, and procedures for each step. They also want a rubric that highlights benefits they might not be aware of. 

Looking at the sequential thinking process provided, the assistant has already broken down components into procedures, identified unconsidered processes, and analyzed hidden benefits. The next step is to synthesize all these thoughts into a coherent rubric and codebase structure.

I need to ensure that the rubric covers all the mentioned aspects: document processing, embedding, database architecture, server implementation, and additional features like feedback loops and security. Also, the codebase should be modular, allowing for easy integration of new models or document types. Error handling and CLI tools for embedding are crucial for usability. 

Potential gaps might include data validation steps, scalability considerations, and how to handle updates to documents. The user might also benefit from monitoring and logging mechanisms to track system performance and usage patterns. 

In terms of code structure, organizing the project into modules for each component (e.g., document processing, embedding, database, server) with clear interfaces would promote maintainability. Using dependency injection for the embedding models can enhance flexibility. 

For the rubric, emphasizing benefits like automated knowledge graph generation, active learning, and cost optimization could provide the user with insights they hadn't considered. Including procedures for testing and validation ensures the system's reliability.

Finally, the assistant should present the rubric in a structured format, outlining each component, procedures, and benefits, while suggesting next steps for the user to implement the codebase.

### Reasoning

Okay, the user wants to create an MCP server for a RAG system to help with coding. They've outlined the main components but need a rubric and advice on processes they might have missed.

First, I need to break down their requirements. They mentioned document text extraction, vectorization with embeddings, and a database setup. Also, they want a server with various search functionalities. The user emphasized using open-source models and CLI tools, handling different document types, and proper equation documentation.

Looking at the sequential thinking steps provided, the assistant has already gone through component breakdown, identified unconsidered processes, analyzed benefits, and outlined an implementation rubric. The final thought gives a detailed rubric with procedures for each part of the project.

I need to ensure that the rubric covers all the user's requirements and adds value by including processes they might not have thought of. For example, the assistant added feedback loops, security layers, and performance optimizations. These are important for a robust system.

The user also needs to use open-source models, so the rubric should mention HuggingFace Transformers for model flexibility. The CLI functionality for embedding is covered with typer. The database part uses LanceDB with IVF-PQ indexing, which is efficient for vector searches.

I should check if all the user's points are addressed. Document processing with PDF libraries, equation handling with LaTeX, and different document types are included. The server part with FastAPI and hybrid search meets their needs. The additional features like feedback collection and ACLs add security and improve the system's adaptability.

The benefits identified, like automated concept mapping and query difficulty scoring, enhance the system's usefulness beyond basic RAG. The cost optimization and extensibility ensure the system can grow and adapt.

Now, the final answer should present the rubric clearly, following the assistant's structured approach. Each section should have actionable steps, and the benefits should be highlighted. The user might need next steps, like starting with the document processing pipeline or setting up the database schema.

Following the steps that you have provided.  I have given you access to the working director for the repo. Build out the implementation of this MCP server using the knowledge created above.

## CodeCompanion (Ollama)

### Reasoning

Okay, the user wants me to build out the implementation of the MCP server based on the rubric we discussed. Let me start by understanding the structure they need. They mentioned using a specific directory structure, so I should create that first. The main components are document processing, embedding, database, server, and utilities.

First, I need to set up the directory structure. The user provided a working directory, so I'll create folders for each component. The `data/` directory will hold processed documents and embeddings. The `src/` directory will contain the main code for each module.

Next, the document processing pipeline. They want to extract text from PDFs, detect structure, and parse equations. I'll use `pdfplumber` for PDF extraction. For structure detection, regex patterns can identify chapters and sections. Equations need to be extracted using LaTeX regex, maybe with `re` and `sympy` for parsing.

Then, the embedding system. The user mentioned using the `nomic-text-embed` model but wants flexibility. I'll create an `Embedder` class using HuggingFace's `transformers` library, allowing easy switching of models. The CLI tool will use `typer` to process documents and generate embeddings.

For the database, LanceDB is the choice. I'll set up a schema with tables for documents and summaries. The `LanceDBHandler` class will manage connections, indexing, and data insertion. Using IVF-PQ indexing will optimize search performance.

The server component needs to be built with FastAPI. Endpoints for hybrid search, metadata filters, and feedback collection are essential. Security features like JWT authentication and rate limiting with `slowapi` will be added. The context augmentation middleware will help in providing relevant document snippets to the LLM.

Additional features like feedback collection and document version tracking need to be implemented. The feedback endpoint will store user ratings to improve model performance. Document versioning can use checksums to track changes.

I should also handle error cases and logging. Each module should have proper exception handling, and logging will help in debugging. The `utils/` directory will contain helper functions for text cleaning, equation parsing, and metadata extraction.

Testing each component is crucial. Unit tests for the document processor, embedder, and database interactions should be written. The server should have test cases for all endpoints to ensure reliability.

Finally, the user might need a CLI tool for embedding documents. Using `typer`, I'll create commands to process and embed documents, making it easy to use from the terminal.

Putting it all together, I'll start by creating the directory structure, then implement each component step by step. Ensuring modularity will make the codebase maintainable and extendable. I'll also make sure to document each part so the user can understand and modify the code as needed.


### Response


`mkdir -p src/{document_processing,embedding,db,server,utils} data/{raw,processed,embeddings}`
```

```


### Reasoning

Okay, the user wants to build out the MCP server based on the rubric we created. First, I need to structure the project. The previous step created the necessary directories. Now, I should start with the document processing pipeline.

I'll begin by creating a PDF parser in the document_processing directory. Using pdfplumber makes sense for extracting text. I'll need to handle chapters and sections with regex. Also, detecting LaTeX equations is important, so integrating sympy for parsing equations would work.

Next, the embedding system. The user mentioned using the nomic-text-embed model, so I'll set up an abstract class in the embedding directory. This class will allow swapping models easily. Implementing batch processing with retries using tenacity will ensure reliability.

For the database, LanceDB needs a schema with vector columns and metadata. Creating a base class for database interactions in the db directory will handle connections and table creation. The schema should include fields for content vectors and summaries.

The server component will use FastAPI. Setting up endpoints for hybrid search, metadata filters, and feedback collection is essential. Adding rate limiting and JWT authentication middleware will secure the API.

I also need to create a CLI tool with typer for embedding documents. This tool will process files from the data/raw directory, extract text, generate embeddings, and store them in the database.

Testing each component step by step is crucial. Starting with the document parser, then moving to embeddings, database interactions, and finally the server endpoints. Writing unit tests for each module will ensure everything works as expected.

I should also consider error handling and logging throughout the codebase. Proper documentation for each module will help in maintaining the code. Finally, setting up a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies will make the project reproducible.

Okay.  Please continue

## CodeCompanion (Ollama)

### Reasoning

Okay, the user wants me to build out the implementation of their MCP server based on the rubric we created. Let me start by recalling the structure we discussed. The project has directories for document processing, embedding, database, server, and utils, along with data directories for raw, processed, and embeddings.

First, I need to create the necessary files in the src directory. The main files would be the entry points for each component. For example, document_processing.py, embedding.py, db.py, server.py, and utils.py. Also, an __init__.py in each directory to make them packages.

I should start with the document processing module. The user mentioned using pdfplumber for text extraction and regex for structure detection. I'll create a function in document_processing.py that uses pdfplumber to extract text and then applies regex to identify sections like chapters and equations. Also, they want LaTeX equations parsed, so integrating sympy for equation detection makes sense.

Next, the embedding module. The user wants a flexible model abstraction layer using HuggingFace's transformers. I'll create an Embedder class that initializes with a model name and provides an embed method. The CLI interface with typer should be in a separate file, maybe cli.py, to handle command-line arguments for document embedding.

For the database, LanceDB schema needs to be set up. The db module will handle connecting to LanceDB, creating tables, and inserting data. The schema should include vector columns and metadata. Also, implementing IVF-PQ indexing for efficient searches.

The server component uses FastAPI. I'll create endpoints for hybrid search, metadata filters, and feedback. Adding rate limiting with slowapi and JWT authentication middleware for security. The context augmentation middleware will help in formatting the results for LLMs.

Utils will contain helper functions, like logging, error handling, and maybe some common regex patterns. The requirements.txt should list all dependencies like pdfplumber, transformers, fastapi, etc.

I need to make sure each file is created with the correct structure. Let me outline the files first. For example, in src/document_processing/document_processing.py, the code will import pdfplumber and sympy, define functions for text extraction and equation parsing.

Then, in src/embedding/embedding.py, the Embedder class using HuggingFace's AutoModel and AutoTokenizer. The CLI in src/cli.py will use typer to accept document paths and trigger the embedding process.

The database setup in src/db/db.py will connect to LanceDB, create tables, and handle data insertion. The server in src/server/server.py will define the FastAPI app with the necessary routes and middleware.

I should also create a main.py in the src directory to serve as the entry point for the server. This will import the FastAPI app and run it with uvicorn.

Now, I need to write the code for each file step by step. Starting with the document processing module. Then the embedding, followed by the database, server, and utilities. Each part must be tested to ensure they fit together as per the rubric.

Wait, the user mentioned using the nomic-text-embed model with 1024 dimensions. I should specify that in the Embedder class. Also, the CLI should allow switching models, so the Embedder class should accept a model name parameter.

For the database, the schema needs to be created with LanceDB. The code should handle connecting to the database, creating tables if they don't exist, and inserting the processed documents with their embeddings.

The server's hybrid search endpoint should combine keyword and vector searches. Maybe using a vector similarity score along with metadata filters to return the most relevant results.

I also need to include error handling and logging throughout the code. For example, in the document processing, if a PDF can't be read, it should log an error and skip that file.

Once all the code is in place, the user can run the CLI to process documents, embed them, and then start the server to access the API endpoints. The requirements.txt will ensure all dependencies are installed.

Let me start by writing the code for each file, making sure to follow the structure and include all necessary components as outlined in the rubric.
